# PR Agent Cursor Rules

## Code Style
- Use Python PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (never tabs)
- Line length should not exceed 120 characters
- Use double quotes for strings unless single quotes avoid escaping
- Add trailing commas in multi-line data structures

## Naming Conventions
- Use snake_case for variables, functions, and module names
- Use PascalCase for class names
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Prefix private methods and attributes with underscore

## Best Practices
- Always use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Use docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Prefer f-strings over .format() or % formatting
- Use pathlib.Path instead of os.path for file operations
- Always handle exceptions explicitly, avoid bare except clauses

## Patterns to Avoid
- Don't use global variables
- Avoid nested functions with more than 2 levels
- Don't leave print() statements in production code
- Never commit TODO comments without GitHub issues
- Avoid importing * (star imports)

## Error Handling
- Use specific exception types instead of generic Exception
- Always log errors with appropriate context
- Use try/except blocks close to the failing operation
- Prefer early returns to reduce nesting

## Documentation
- All public functions must have docstrings
- Use Google-style docstrings format
- Include type information in docstrings when not obvious
- Document complex algorithms with inline comments

## Testing
- Write unit tests for all new functions
- Use descriptive test method names
- Follow AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
- Mock external dependencies in tests
